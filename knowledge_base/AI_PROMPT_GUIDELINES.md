# AI Prompt Engineering Context

To ensure the AI doesn't lose the "soul" of the Vedic content, the following rules apply to all LLM requests:

1. **Terminology Retention:** Do not translate specific Sanskrit terms like *Sade Sati*, *Dharma*, *Karma*, *Lagna*, or *Nakshatra*. Keep them in Sanskrit but written in English script (Transliteration).
2. **Tone:** Maintain a "Scholarly and Respectful" tone. Avoid clickbait language.
3. **Date Accuracy:** When extracting dates, the AI must verify the context. If the text says "last year in October," the AI should not list it as an upcoming "Important Date."
4. **Summary Structure:**
   - Paragraph 1: What is the transit/event?
   - Paragraph 2: What is the spiritual impact?
   - Paragraph 3: What is the recommended remedy/action?
